Elevate your workout with Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Isolate.


Ultra-filtered for exceptional purity
25g of pure whey protein isolate per serving
5.5g of naturally occurring BCAA's in each serving

Optimum Nutrition start by selecting only the highest quality whey proteins which undergo a series of sophisticated filtration processes to ‘isolate’ out excess fat, sugar and lactose content, leaving mainly protein. A portion of this whey protein isolate is then hydrolysed – broken down into smaller chains of amino acids.The final product is a complete protein containing no more than 0.3g of sugars, 0.4g of fat and 83% of pure protein per serving. We put in the hard work to assure superior quality so you can focus on achieving your performance goals.


Add 1 rounded scoop (30g) of chocolate flavour ready-to-mix whey isolate protein powder to 200ml of cold water and stir, shake or blend until dissolved. You can also add a serving to smoothies, protein balls, muffins, porridge or other meals as another great way to get a protein hit in the kitchen.
