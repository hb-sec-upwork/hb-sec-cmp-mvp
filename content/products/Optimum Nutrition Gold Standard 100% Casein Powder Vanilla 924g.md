24g of slow digesting micellar casein per serving
Contains naturally occurring BCAAs (Leucine, Isoleucine & Valine)
For slow digesting protein support between meals & before bed
Sometimes slower is better - especially when it comes to the rate of protein digestion. While rapid protein absorption is desirable right before or after exercise, delayed release is probably more beneficial throughout the remainder of the day, & especially last thing at night.


Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Strawberry Casein Powder contains slow-digesting micellar protein, and can be made into a smoothie, shake, or delicious protein ice cream as a before bed snack.
Directions: Add one scoop of Gold Standard 100% Casein to 300 - 350 ml of water or prefered beverage. Use first thing in the morning, immediately before bed, in place of small meals, and/or any other time when delayed protein absorption is desired. To make protein ice cream, just mix one scoop into half the amount of water you normally use (150-180ml), place in the freezer for about 5 minutes - then enjoy!
